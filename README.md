## Abstract

Geox is a high-performance, **web-based 3D engine** designed for real-time rendering and interactive scene manipulation. Developed using **Three.js** and **WebGL**, Geox provides an efficient and accessible environment for 3D modeling, visualization, and game development. Its modular architecture supports **custom scripting**, **shader development**, and **dynamic scene management**, making it a suitable tool for both academic research and industry applications.

---

## Introduction

The advent of **WebGL and modern JavaScript frameworks** has enabled the development of real-time **3D rendering engines** within web browsers, eliminating the need for native applications. **Geox** is an open-source initiative designed to bridge the gap between **high-performance 3D rendering** and web accessibility.  

This document provides an in-depth overview of **Geox's architecture**, **functionalities**, and **deployment methodologies**, aiming to assist researchers, developers, and industry professionals in integrating the system into their projects.

## Features

### Core Functionalities
- **Real-Time Rendering**: Utilizes WebGL for high-performance **3D graphics rendering**.
- **Scene Management**: Allows users to save, load, and modify 3D environments dynamically.
- **Custom Scripting**: Users can define object behaviors using JavaScript.
- **Shader Editor**: Supports GLSL shaders for advanced material customization.
- **Multi-Device Compatibility**: Works on **desktop and mobile devices**.
- **Modular Design**: Can be extended with additional plugins.

### Technical Capabilities
- **Object Manipulation**: Real-time translation, rotation, and scaling.
- **Camera Modes**: Supports **FPS and Editor mode** for navigation.
- **Optimized Rendering Pipeline**: Reduces computational overhead via **culling and level-of-detail (LOD) techniques**.
- **Physics Engine (Planned)**: Future releases will include physics-based interactions.

## System Architecture

### Overview
Geox follows a **modular architecture**, ensuring scalability and maintainability. The core system comprises three primary components:

1. **Rendering Engine**  
   - WebGL-based real-time rendering  
   - Shader management system  
   - Frame rate optimization  
   
2. **Scene Graph Manager**  
   - Hierarchical structure for managing objects  
   - JSON-based serialization for scene persistence  
   
3. **Scripting and Interactivity**  
   - JavaScript-based event-driven model  
   - Dynamic object behavior customization

# Geox Installation, Usage, and Contribution Guide

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (Recommended for Local Development)
* Modern Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

### Deployment Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/GeorgMichelle/Geox-engine.git]
    cd Geox
    ```

2.  **Running Locally (Without Server)**

    * Open `index.html` in a web browser.

3.  **Running via Local Server**

    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    http-server .
    ```

    * Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

---

## Usage Guidelines

### Object Manipulation

* Add objects via the UI panel.
* Modify transformations (position, rotation, scale).
* Apply shaders for customized visual effects.

### Scripting Interface

* Define object behaviors via JavaScript.
* Access scene objects dynamically.

**Example Script: Continuous Rotation**

```javascript
function update(delta) {
  this.rotation.y += 0.01;
}
```
## Camera Controls

- Navigate the scene using mouse drag & scroll.
- Switch between perspective & orthographic views.

## Rendering and Performance Optimization

### Best Practices

- **LOD (Level of Detail):** Reduce rendering load by dynamically adjusting object details.
- **Frustum Culling:** Discard objects outside the camera’s view.
- **Shader Optimization:** Minimize fragment shader computations.

## Security Considerations

While Geox does not directly interact with backend services, users must be aware of the following:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:** Ensure scripts executed within Geox are sanitized.
- **Memory Management:** Prevent memory leaks by properly deallocating objects.
- **WebGL Security:** Disable unnecessary extensions that may expose hardware details.
